## Installing the Vorto CLI Tool

Download the CLI Tool from the <a href="{{ base }}/downloads/index.html">Vorto Downloads</a> page and save it to any working directory.

A very convenient way to use the CLI Tool is, to add the path of the directory into the system's environment PATH variable. Once you did this, you can call the CLI-Tool from any directory.

For Windows, open **Control Panel -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables**

![Environment Variable]({{base}}/img/documentation/cli_evnmt_variable.jpg)

For Mac/Linux, from a terminal window execute

	export path=%path%:~/Applications/<<vorto cli tool installed directory>>
