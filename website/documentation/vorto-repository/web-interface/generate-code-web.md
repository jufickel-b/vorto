## Generating Code

You can generate code artifacts based on a function model or on an information model in the Vorto Repository for usage in specific solutions. The code generation is carried out in the Vorto Repository backend. You can choose a desired generator from a list of available generators provided in the Vorto Repository.

**Prerequisites**

You have opened the **Model** tab of the information page of the model you want to generate code from (refer to [Menu](./search-web.html#model)).

**Proceed as follows**

1. On the right side, click the link within the graphic of the appropriate generator.  
   ![Generate Code from Web Interface]({{base}}/img/documentation/vorto_repository_generate_code_web_interface.png)  
   The code of your information model is generated according to the choosen generator and the browser's download dialog opens providing a zip file containing this code.
2. Specify the download location and download the zip file.
